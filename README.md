# IMAP Archiver

A simple script for archiving old emails stored on an IMAP server, created to replace the [Awesome Auto Archive](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-GB/thunderbird/addon/awesome-auto-archive/) Thunderbird addon which is sadly no longer compatible.

Simply edit the details of the server to connect to and provide a list of mailboxes to process.  Maximum message age is defaulted to 365 days but is easily changed.
